# Project in TDT13

This repository contains code for the project in TDT13 - Advanced Text Analytics and Language Understanding.

## Trained models
I provide checkpoints for for two different sized models fine-tuned on CUAD: Macaw-large (~100M parameters) and Macaw-3b (~3B parameters).

## Paperspace
All notebooks are run through GPU cloud service provider Paperspace. With Gradient, you get access to a Jupyter Notebook instance backed by a GPU without any complicated configuration. Gradient is built on top of Paperspace, a GPU-accelerated cloud platform.
